Revision history for Linux::Inotify2

TODO: document move/renaming issues for fullname
TODO: find_watchers($path), or maybe just ->watchers

2.1  Fri Oct 26 03:16:03 CEST 2018
	- damn, left debugging code not caught by tests (reported by losyme).

2.0  Thu Oct 25 03:19:08 CEST 2018
	- fix poll and read documentation w.r.t. errors - this changes the
          documented API, but is how the module has always behaved.
	- mention https://lwn.net/Articles/605128/ in the docs.
	- new on_overflow callback, called for overflow events.
        - new ->broadcast method that calls all watchers with some event.
        - automatically broadcast overflow events to all watchers by default.
	- read now returns all events (except ignored ones), not just ones
          it has registered watchers for (e.g. overflow events).
	- reduced dependencies (Mike Pomraning).
        - add IN_EXCL_UNLINK flag.
        - more efficient constant initialisation.

1.22 Tue Jun 14 08:34:38 CEST 2011
	- use a more useful definition of IN_xxx methods - any bits, not
          a match. (pointed out by Anatoliy Grishayev).
        - slightly reworked the documentation.

1.21 Mon Sep 21 10:07:07 CEST 2009
	- fix a couple of typoes, as pointed out by Grant McLean.
        - rely on common::sense for stricter namespace checking.

1.2  Tue Oct  7 19:23:57 CEST 2008
	- include IN_DELETE_SELF in events that cancel watchers, as
          the kernel seems to handle it this way only.
        - require sys/inotify.h to be installed, remove the local
          copy (patch by Adrian Bunk).
        - update examples.

1.1  Fri Sep 29 16:40:14 CEST 2006
	- fixed formatting.
	- add IN_MASK_ADD, IN_DONT_FOLLOW, IN_ONLYDIR.
        - updated inotify.h from inotify-utils for wider architecture support.
        - no internal changes.

1.01 Tue Dec 20 12:31:16 CET 2005
	- more fixes by Andrejs Dubovskis:
	- removed debugging code accidentally left in.
        - streaming API didn't always return properly blessed objects.

1.0  Mon Dec 19 17:48:01 CET 2005
	- incorporated a major patch by Andrejs Dubovskis:
        - added a non-callback interface to read events
        - better error handling in non-blocking case.
        - added test case.
        - fix reading events leaking memory.

0.8  Sun Nov 27 13:43:14 CET 2005
	- improved documentation.
        - added IN_MOVE_SELF.
        - cancel events when receiving an IN_ONESHOT event.
        - clarify documentation for ->cookie.

0.2  Tue Aug 23 04:27:31 CEST 2005
	- poll now really returns the #events.
        - handle multiple cancel's gracefully.
        - auto-cancel watchers on IN_IGNORED and IN_UNMOUNT.
          situation with IN_ONESHOT is unclear
          (does have no effect on 2.6.13-rc6-git13).
        - avoid race between canceled and newly-created watches.
        - improved documentation.

0.1  Mon Aug 22 12:05:15 CEST 2005
	- original version, a Linux::AIO clone.
