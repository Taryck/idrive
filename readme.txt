		Example:  chmod a+x *.pl

IV. SETUP YOUR IDRIVE ACCOUNT
==============================
STEP 1: You need to have an IDrive account to use the script bundle to backup your files. In case you do not have an account,
		please sign up and create an account at https://www.idrive.com/idrive/signup .

STEP 2: To set up IDrive script bundle locally with your IDrive account, run the below command and follow the instructions.
		$./account_setting.pl
		Note: Setting up the script bundle for the first time will ask user to enter the service path. This path will contain user specific data required to perform operations via script bundle.
		      For some IDrive accounts, while configuring account, 'Create new Backup Location'/'Select from existing Backup Locations' options will appear and Mirror/relative backup type option will not appear.

V. WORKING WITH THE SCRIPTS
============================
		Using IDrive scripts, you can:

		- Perform backup/express backup/restore operations
		- View progress for backup/express backup/restore
		- Schedule backup/express backup/restore job
		- View logs files and much more.

STEP 1: Login to your IDrive account
		If you are not logged in to your IDrive account while setting up your script bundle, run the below command to login.
		$./login.pl

		Note: Login script is a mandatory script to be executed before performing any operation. This script will authenticate your IDrive account details and will create a secure session for your backups.

STEP 2: Edit your backup-set/express backup-set/restore-set, and exclude files
		Before starting any backup/express backup/restore operation, the user must add the list of files/folders required for each operation in the backup/express backup/restore set file.

		To update these details in the backup/express backup/restore set file, you must execute the below command:
		$./edit_supported_files.pl

		The menu option will be displayed. Select option 1 to edit the backup set file. Respective file will open in vi editor to edit. Add the files/folders that needs to be backed up.
		Using same script you can update backup set, express backup set, restore set and exclude files by selecting the desired option.

		Exclude Files/Folder from your backup set
		=========================================
		By using the Exclude option of edit supported file script, you can exclude files/ folders from being backed up to your IDrive account.

		1. Full Path Exclude
		2. Partial Path Exclude
		3. Regex Exclude

		Full Path Exclude
		=================
		To exclude files/folders with full path,

		1. Run 'edit_supported_files.pl' script and select option 'Edit Your Full Path Exclude List'. The 'FullExcludeList.txt' file will open in vi editor.
		2. Add full path of the files/folders that you wish to exclude.
		3. Enter each item in a new line.
		4. Save and exit.

		Example:
		Your Backupset contains /home/Documents and if you want to exclude /home/Documents/temp, enter the folder path ie: ‘/home/Documents/temp’ in FullExcludeList file.

		Partial Path Exclude
		====================
		To exclude files/folders with partial path,

		1. Run 'edit_supported_files.pl' script and select option 'Edit Your Partial Path Exclude List'. The 'PartialExcludeList.txt' file will open in vi editor.
		2. Add partial name of the files/folders that you wish to exclude.
		3. Enter each item in a new line.
		4. Save and exit.

		Example:
		Your Backupset contains /home/Documents and if you want to exclude all the pst files from this folder like /home/Documents/designtutorials.pst, /home/Documents/new.pst, /home/Documents/James/tutorials.pst etc, then enter ‘pst’ in PartialExcludeList file.

		Regex Exclude
		=============
		To exclude files/folders based on regex pattern,

		1. Run 'edit_supported_files.pl' script and select option 'Edit Your Regex Exclude List'. The 'RegexExcludeList.txt' file will open in vi editor.
		2. Add the regex pattern of the files/folders that you wish to exclude.
		3. Enter each item in a new line.
		4. Save and exit.

		Example:
		Your Backupset contains /home/Folder01 , /home/Folder02, /home/FolderA, /home/FolderB. If you want to exclude all folders/files that contains numeric values in name ie: /home/Folder01, /home/Folder02 etc, then enter ‘\d+’ in RegexExcludeList file.

STEP 3: Immediate/Manual backup
		You can perform immediate/manual backup using the below command:
		$./Backup_Script.pl

		When you run your backup script, it will reconfirm your backup location and allow you to change it. You can now view the graphical progress bar for your data getting backed up.
		If you want your script not to ask for backup location and not to display progress bar then you can always use "--silent" flag with this command.

		Note: For some IDrive accounts this script will not provide an option to change 'Backup location'.


STEP 4: Immediate/Manual express backup
		You can perform immediate/manual express backup using the below command:
		$./express_backup.pl

		Using this script, you can backup your Linux machine data to the express device shipped to you. Once the data is backed up, you can ship this express device back to us and within a week your data will be available in your IDrive account.
		For more details on express, visit https://www.idrive.com/linux-express-backup

STEP 5:	Immediate/Manual restore
		You can perform immediate/manual restore using the below command:
		$./Restore_Script.pl

		When you run your restore script, it will reconfirm your restore and restore from location and will allow you to change it if required.
		You can now view the graphical progress bar for your data getting restored.
		If you want your script not to ask for restore location, restore from location and not to display progress bar then you can always use "--silent" flag with this command.

		Note: For some IDrive accounts, user will not be able to edit 'Restore From' manually and have to select 'Restore From' location from the list of existing locations.

STEP 6:	Schedule backup/express backup/archive cleanup job
		Run the below command to manage your schedule backup/express backup/archive cleanup job:
		$./scheduler.pl

		Select the desired menu option to create, edit, view or delete your schedule backup / express backup / archive cleanup job and follow the instructions.
		In case you want your schedule job to stop automatically at a scheduled time then set the cut-off time as well, while following the instructions.

STEP 7: View progress of scheduled backup/express backup
		To view the progress of scheduled backup or express backup operation, run the below command:
		$./Status_Retrieval_Script.pl

STEP 8: View/restore previous versions of a file
		You can view the list of previous versions of any file and select any version that you want to restore. To retrieve a file with earlier versions, run the below command:
		$./restore_version.pl

		Note: For some IDrive accounts, user will not be able to edit 'Restore From' location manually and have to select 'Restore From' location from the list of existing locations.

STEP 9:	Stop ongoing backup/express backup/restore operations
		To stop an ongoing backup or express backup or restore operation, run the below command:
		$./job_termination.pl

STEP 10: View/Delete operation logs
		You can view or delete the logs for backup, express backup, restore and archive cleanup operations using the below command:
		$./logs.pl

STEP 11: Archive cleanup
		Archive Cleanup compares the files of your local storage, selected for backup, with the files in your IDrive online backup account. It then deletes the files present in your account but not on your local machine.
		This feature thus helps you to free up space in your online backup account.

		To perform archive cleanup run below command:
		$./archive_cleanup.pl

		When you run the script to perform archive cleanup, you can enter a percentage of the total no. of files to be considered for deletion. This percentage based control helps to avoid large-scale deletion of files in your account.

STEP 12: Send error report
		You can send error report to IDrive support by running the below command:
		$./send_error_report.pl

STEP 13: Logout from your IDrive account
		To end the logged in session for your IDrive account, run the below command:
		$./logout.pl

		You must logout (optional) from the account to avoid any unauthorized access to your IDrive account. After logout, you needs to login again to perform most of the operations.
		Note: Your scheduled backup / scheduled express backup / periodic cleanup jobs will run even after you logout.

STEP 14: Help
		To view help page content by running the below command and follow the instructions:
		$./help.pl

VI. UPDATING YOUR SCRIPT BUNDLE
